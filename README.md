# Weather App

WeatherApp for the odin project. It will utilise openWeather API on it's free plan and potentially the giphy API for custom gifs related to the weather. I also plan to use promises and async/ await a large amount in this project.

## PLAN

1. Set up base project using webpack, ESlint, prettier, and normalize CSS.

2. Write functions that hit the openWeather API. The functions for weather will need to take a location as an input and return the weather data for that location. Console.log() the data to make sure they all work properly.

3. Write functions to process the JSON data that is recieved from the openWeather API and return only the data that is needed for the weather app.

4. Set up a form to allow users to input location, then fetch the weather info for what they've inputted.
